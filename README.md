# MyTabBar

An attempt at a custom tab bar which focusing on the layout of the tab bar items.

The tab bar items are laid out using a series of `UIStackView`s and is intended to allow the text to either truncate or wrap over two lines if it's two long

# To Do:

* Font customisation
* Color customisation
* Support for `apperence`?
* Monitor more properties of the `UITabBarItem` ...?
